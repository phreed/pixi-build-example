= An Example `pixi-build` 

A place to try out different structures.

I made a sample project.
First I replicated the sample from https://pixi.sh/latest/build/python/ in a branch,
https://github.com/phreed/pixi-build-example/tree/00_original
It works as advertised.

Next, I replicated the example from https://pixi.sh/latest/build/workspace/ in a branch,
https://github.com/phreed/pixi-build-example/tree/01-multi-cmath
Also, works as advertised.

Now, I split the python piece into a driver and a library, in a branch
https://github.com/phreed/pixi-build-example/tree/01-multi-pkg
It seems to still work.

I will see if it will continue to work if I merge the pixi.toml into the pyproject.toml.
Do these examples already exist somewhere?
